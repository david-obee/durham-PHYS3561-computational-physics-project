*Two optimisation algorithms from a computational physics project completed in the final year of my Bachelor's. It looks at neutron scattering off nuclei.*

I have attached a genetic algorithm, and a particle swarm algorithm. I have also attached the report and poster I produced detailing my project. In `report.pdf` you will find an overview of the two optimisation algorithms, how they were used, and their results.
